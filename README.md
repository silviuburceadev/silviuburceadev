### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Silviu!

I'm a full-stack developer with a "work smarter, not harder" attitude. I'm mostly coding in Java and Javascript/Node.js but I'm really a polyglot, as I can pick up languages and frameworks pretty fast. 

Îœy interest in code quality and testing allows me to raise the bar for any project that comes my way, including modernizing legacy projects or even resurrecting dead projects. I do enjoy living on the edge tho, working with latest and greatest technologies.

When I'm not coding, I'm a full-time runner, father and husband.
